AutoValue – Get the Right Price

AutoValue is a comprehensive Python-based web application designed to assist users in making informed decisions when purchasing used cars. The platform aggregates real-time car listings and insightful automotive blogs from multiple websites, providing a centralized hub for all things automotive.

The standout feature of AutoValue is its used car price prediction model, which utilizes machine learning to estimate the fair market value of a vehicle based on key parameters such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and location. This predictive capability empowers users to evaluate car prices confidently.

Key Features and Technologies Used:

    Web Development: Built the backend using Flask for a seamless and scalable architecture.
    Web Scraping: Employed Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Scrapy to collect car listings and blog content from various sources.
    Machine Learning: Developed and trained a predictive model using Linear Regression with a high R² score of 0.82. Data preprocessing and feature engineering were performed using Pandas and NumPy.
    APIs: Created standalone RESTful APIs for serving aggregated car listings, blog content, and predicted prices, ensuring modularity and easy integration.
    Frontend Integration: Designed and integrated the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a user-friendly interface.
    Data Visualization: Leveraged Matplotlib and Seaborn for exploratory data analysis and insights.
    Deployment: Deployed the application on a cloud platform for real-time accessibility.

This project not only showcases expertise in integrating machine learning models with web applications but also demonstrates proficiency in handling end-to-end development, from data collection to user delivery.
